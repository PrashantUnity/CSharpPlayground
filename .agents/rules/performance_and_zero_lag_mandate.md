# Performance & Scale Mandate: zero-lag pages, tabs and files, at any workspace size

This rule applies strictly to `examples/CSharpEditorPlugin` (`com.frypdf.plugin.csharpeditor`). It is the plugin's counterpart of FryPDF's `performance_and_zero_lag_mandate.md`, and it exists because this studio is used on **very large codebases**: anything that is merely slow on a small workspace is unusable on a big one. All AI agents and developers must follow it.

---

## 1. Pages are built once and kept alive
- The studio host shows its pages through `Controls/KeepAlivePageHost`: a page's view is built the first time it is shown and only shown or hidden afterwards. **Never** show a page with a `ContentControl` + `DataTemplate` (that rebuilds the whole view, its styles and its editors on every switch, and the views it drops stay subscribed to the long-lived view models).
- A new page is registered in `CSharpStudioHostView`'s constructor. A page view model that owns timers, polling or animations implements `ViewModels/IPageLifecycle` and starts them in `OnActivated` and stops them in `OnDeactivated`. Hidden pages stay in the visual tree, so animations pause on `IsEffectivelyVisible`, not on detach.

## 2. Never block the UI thread
- No `.Result`, `.Wait()` or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on the UI thread; no file, process or network access there either. Heavy work goes through `Task.Run` with a `CancellationToken`.

## 3. Never scan the workspace on a hot path
- Switching a tab, switching a page, opening a file or typing must **not** walk the workspace or read its documents. Consumers remember `IScriptStorageService.StructureVersion` (tree shape) or `ContentVersion` (titles, modified times) and reload only when it moved (`RefreshExplorerIfStaleAsync`, `ReloadIfStaleAsync`), usually from `IPageLifecycle.OnActivated`.
- Every operation that changes the workspace bumps the versions (`LocalScriptStorageService.MarkChanged`); files changed by other programs are noticed by `WorkspaceWatcher` (`ExternalChangeDetected`). A new mutating storage method must call `MarkChanged`.
- Tests can prove it: `LocalScriptStorageService.WorkspaceScanCount` must not move on a tab switch (`WorkspaceStalenessTests`).

## 4. Virtualize every list that can grow
- A list that can exceed ~100 rows is virtualized (`VirtualizingStackPanel` as the items panel, with the `ScrollViewer` in the `ItemsControl` template, or a `ListBox`). Never nest `ItemsControl`s to draw a tree and never put an `ItemsControl` inside a `ScrollViewer` for a growing collection.
- The Explorer binds to `ExplorerRowList.Rows` (a flat list of the visible rows). Change many items through `Suspend()` and `RangeObservableCollection` (one notification), never with thousands of `Add` calls.
- Virtualized today: the Explorer, the notebook canvas (`NotebookCanvasRows`: a header row, a row per cell, a footer row), the notebook Outline and Search panels, and the Blind 75 table. A virtualizing panel treats a vertical margin on its presenter as part of the area it must fill, so keep vertical gaps out of the presenter (use header and footer rows) or the strip they cover stays empty while scrolling.
- Known debt: the Hub's workspace list (`HubWorkspacesPanelControl`) is not virtualized; it draws at most 100 cards and offers "Show more".

## 4b. Build the heavy parts of a repeated item on demand
- XAML builds everything it declares, and `IsVisible` does not stop that. A notebook cell used to build a table, a chart, a 3D plot, an inspector and an HTML view even when it only printed text. Put such a part in the template of `Controls/LazyContent` and bind its `IsActive` to "this kind of output is showing": it is built the first time it is needed.
- Hunt the cost with an experiment, not a guess: remove sections of a template one at a time and time the result (the output control was ~80% of a cell's cost; the menus everyone suspected were ~10%).

## 4c. Find files through the index, never by walking
- `IScriptStorageService.FileIndex` (`WorkspaceFileIndex`) holds the path of every file in the workspace: built by a cancellable background walk, searchable while it is still building, rebuilt when the workspace changes. "Go to File" (Ctrl+P) and any future search over files must take their file list from it, never walk the folder themselves, and never on the UI thread.
- The Hub's list (`LoadWorkspaceSummariesAsync`) stops at `WorkspaceFileLimit` files and says so (`IsWorkspaceTruncated`): a limit must never be silent.
- **The Explorer never stops at a limit: it lists a big workspace one folder at a time.** `IScriptStorageService.LoadExplorerListingAsync` lists the whole workspace when it fits `WorkspaceFileLimit`; otherwise it returns only the top folder (`WorkspaceListing.IsPartial`) and `ListFolderAsync(relativeFolder)` lists each folder when it is opened. `LazyExplorerTree` (shared by both studios) draws that: an unlisted folder holds a "Loading..." placeholder row, opening it lists it (`ExplorerItemViewModel.LoadChildrenRequested`), `RevealAsync` opens the folders down to the open document, and a rebuild opens the folders that were open again. Rows of a folder that is opened are patched in with `ExplorerRowList.ChangeChildren`, never by rebuilding the whole list. Code that edits the tree (new file or folder under a folder) must list an unlisted folder first, or the listing that follows adds the new item a second time.
- **Find in Files** (`WorkspaceTextSearch`, the Search panel's "search the whole workspace" toggle): reads `FileIndex.Paths` on background threads, several files at once, streams matches in file-list order, stops at `MaxMatches` (2,000) and `MaxMatchesPerFile`, skips binary and huge files, searches open documents as the editor holds them, and is cancelled by the next keystroke. Results reach the (virtualized) list in batches. Any other search over the workspace follows these rules.

## 5. Per-keystroke and per-switch work is independent of document size
- Do not copy or scan the whole document on the UI thread per keystroke or per tab switch: no `Document.Text` to compare (use a chunked compare), no whole-text regex (see `DirectiveScanInlineLimit`), at most one folding pass, and documents above `LargeDocumentLength` fold shortly after they are shown.
- Any new feature attached to text changes must be measured on the 2 MB case below.
- **Large documents give up what grows with size.** Above `CSharpCodeStudioViewModel.LargeDocumentLength` (500,000 chars) live diagnostics are off (a Roslyn compile of the whole file after every pause in typing made the garbage collector stall each keystroke; running the file still reports its problems), and foldings are capped at `FoldingLimits.MaxFoldings` (2,000, deepest blocks dropped first). AvaloniaEdit walks every folding for each visual line it builds and redraws a folding's whole range on every edit inside it (measured on a bare editor too): 18,000 foldings cost about 12 ms per keystroke, none cost 1 ms. Even an ordinary file pays about 3 ms per keystroke for its outermost folding; a replacement folding generator would be the next step.

## 6. Clean up what you hook up
- Every `+=` on a longer-lived object needs its `-=`. Views that hook a view model implement `IDisposable` (`CSharpCodeStudioView.Dispose`), and `KeepAlivePageHost.Dispose` calls it.
- Timers get an explicit `DispatcherPriority` (never `Render` for decoration) and stop while their page is hidden.

## 6b. Loading and progress: report work, never block for it
- Work the user may wait for is reported to `Services/Activities/IActivityService` (`using var a = activities.Start(new ActivityOptions("Opening data.csv", ActivityLocation.Editor))`, or `RunAsync`). View models get the service through an optional constructor parameter (default `NullActivityService.Instance`); the studio host owns the one `ActivityService` and its `ActivityPresenterViewModel`. No view model owns loading state of its own, and nothing is static.
- **Producers say what, presenters decide how.** The rules live in `ActivityTiming`: nothing shows before 250 ms (a tab switch never shows anything), a thin line in the zone doing the work (`ActivityProgressLine`, `Location="Editor|Notebook|Explorer|Hub|Window"`) and the status-bar entry (`ActivityStatusItem`) after that, a toast with Cancel after 2 s when the work can be cancelled or reports progress, and once shown it stays 400 ms so it never flickers. Failures become error toasts (`IActivity.Fail`, `RunAsync`, `FireAndForget`), never only `Debug.WriteLine`.
- **The branded card (`StudioLoadingOverlayControl`) is for blocking work only**: `ActivityOptions.Blocking` (switching workspace, the first workspace list at cold start, which gives way after `YieldAfter`). It appears after 400 ms. Never use it for opening a file or a tab.
- **Never wait to make something visible**: no `Task.Delay` before or after work "so the spinner shows", no `await Dispatcher.UIThread.InvokeAsync(() => {}, DispatcherPriority.Render)` to paint a loading state. Work that blocks the UI thread cannot show progress anyway; move it off the thread.
- **Latest wins**: opening document B while A is loading cancels A (`LatestOperation`); after every await, check the token before touching the screen. Two loads of the same document at once share one read (`SingleFlight`). Fire-and-forget goes through `FireAndForget(activities, "what")`, never `_ = ...` or `async void`.
- **Start-up is staged** (`Services/Startup/EngineReadiness`): Core (compiler service and studio view models) is all an open waits for; Warm (the first compilation) runs after it as a status-bar activity. A failed Core is started again by the next open.
- **Artifacts never decode or parse on the UI thread, and never in full when it is not shown**: images through `Services/Display/ImageDecoder` (header-only sizes, background decode, at most 4096 px wide, nothing over 256 MB), notebook image outputs decoded the first time they are shown, CSV previews parsed off the thread above 64 KB, capped at 100,000 rows and debounced while the text changes, tables virtualized (`DumpTableRowsList`), and `DumpTableResult` rows added in bulk (`AddRows`) or appended without re-filtering. Source files are sized and sniffed (8 KB) before reading; above `MaxEditorFileBytes` (50 MB) or binary, the editor gets a description that is never saved over the file.
- A code-built `ItemsControl` template must hand `ItemsPresenter.ItemsPanel` the `VirtualizingStackPanel` itself: the presenter otherwise makes a plain `StackPanel` and every item is built (the theme's ItemsControl style also overrides a default `ItemsPanel`).

## 7. Styles
- **`Styles/StudioStyles.axaml` is included exactly once, by `CSharpStudioHostView`** (and at application level by the Runner and `tools/UiSnapshots`); every page and control below the host inherits it. Never include it in a page, a control, a row or a cell. It is a bundle of 15 style files and the palette tokens: one include costs **~29 ms and ~5 MB**, and every style in it is matched against every control below the include. Removing the 36 per-control and per-page includes halved the studio's memory after a visit of every page (1,021 MB → 546 MB) and roughly halved the first visit of Settings and the Notebook.
- A window of its own (outside the host's tree, like `AiComposerWindow`) adds the include once to itself. Flyouts, tooltips and context menus inherit from their owner and need nothing.
- To check that a change still looks right in the plugin (where FryPDF's application has none of the studio's styles), render with `FRY_PLUGIN_STYLES_ONLY=1` and compare with a normal render (`images.py compare`); only the live memory readout may differ.

## Verification
Time the real studio, headless, on a generated workspace:

```bash
dotnet build tools/UiSnapshots
dotnet tools/UiSnapshots/bin/Debug/net10.0/UiSnapshots.dll perf --files 200 --rounds 3 --big-kb 2048 --cells 1000 --external 30000
dotnet tools/UiSnapshots/bin/Debug/net10.0/UiSnapshots.dll perf --files 200 --rounds 3 --open-early --big-csv-mb 1 --big-image-mp 24
dotnet tools/UiSnapshots/bin/Debug/net10.0/UiSnapshots.dll perf --table-rows 100000
```
Every scenario also prints the **longest input wait**: a background thread keeps a tiny job queued at input priority and records how long it waited, which is what a user feels as a hang.
